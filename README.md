This package is a wrapper around the standard [`encoding/json` package](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json)
to improve the reporting of location for unmarshalling errors:
[`UnmarshalTypeError`](https://golang.org/pkg/encoding/json/#UnmarshalTypeError) are enhanced to also include
a JSON Pointer (see RFC6901) indicating the location of the error: see
[`jsonptrerror.UnmarshalTypeError`](https://godoc.org/github.com/dolmen-go/jsonptrerror#UnmarshalTypeError).

## Status

The aim is code coverage of 100%. Use go coverage tools and consider any
code not covered by the testsuite as never tested and full of bugs.
